Ai
Private MORGENSHTERN here, bitch (Glory, what did you do?)
Ay, prepare the guns, yey, yey, ee-ee
Yey (Yay), yey

[Chorus]
Pull up in the tank and I'm going to fight (Yay)
Here I am the captain, fighting cowboy (Yay)
Bought a new TU, it's a plane (Yay)
Lying-too-too-too-too-too-tuf is a helicopter (Yay)
Pull up in the tank and I'm going to fight (Yay)
Here I am the captain, fighting cowboy (Yay)
Bought a new TU, it's a plane (Yay)
"Be-e" - and it's you who died
[Verse]
Ah, twisted on the battlefield, like a vertical
Uh, bitch catch a bullet on my torpedo (Nah)
Ah, I'll put blunt meat on a spit (Shawarma)
Ah, I'm ahead, and you're ahead (Ha)

[Bridge]
Fuck Lambo' (Yay), jump on a plane (Woah)
Hey stupid sucker (Lox), suck the barrel (Suck)
Fuck Lambo' (Fuck), jump on a plane (Ugh)
Hey stupid sucker (Lox), suck the barrel (Suck)
